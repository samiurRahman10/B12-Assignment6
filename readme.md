1-var is function-scoped and can be redeclared, let is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared, const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

2-forEach() loops through elements and returns nothing, map() returns a new array with transformed values, and filter() returns a new array with elements that pass a condition.

3-Arrow functions use ()=> syntax, are shorter than regular functions, and do not have their own this context.

4-Destructuring assignment extracts values from arrays or objects into variables in a single statement, and template literals use backticks ` with ${} to insert variables instead of + concatenation.

5-Template literals allow multi-line strings and embedding expressions directly, unlike normal strings that need concatenation or \n for new lines.
